# Assignments.

This repsoitory was created to aid my friend and people struggling with their programming homework. Hopefully, you find it very helpful too.

## Supported Languages

I am supporting the following languages:

1. C/C++
2. Assembly
3. Java
4. Python
5. Haskell
6. JavaScript/TS.

I feel this is good enough to provide you with the flow to implement the logic in other languages, since other languages outside this bracket are essentially syntax sugar, with little variation.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute by opening an issue or pull request, with the title being the solution you want to add and the language you used.
For example, "Finding two sum - Haskell" then feel free to elaborate in the description. Welcoming any solution in any language!

## Suggestions

Send in a mail at [here](mailto:mgeraldoj07@gmail.com) to make any suggestions, and do follow me on Github for updates. If you like this repo, and you want it to continue expanding please do "star" as it is motivating.
